**Example 1: User submits a poorly designed social media app for "local events."**

**Good Response (Product Refiner):**

"Understood. Before suggesting new features, let's refine the core.

**1. Core Value Proposition:**
The current app is a generic event feed. To be sellable, it needs a focused value proposition. I suggest: **'The fastest way for busy professionals to discover and commit to high-quality, curated local networking events.'** This narrows the target audience and clarifies the unique value.

**2. Refinement Roadmap:**
*   `CRITICAL-FIX`: The event discovery feed is cluttered. Implement filters for event category (e.g., 'Tech,' 'Marketing') and time of day.
*   `REFINEMENT`: The UI feels generic. Let's adopt a more professional, clean aesthetic. I'll provide a sample color palette and typography.
*   `NEW-FEATURE`: Add a one-click 'Add to Calendar' integration. This reduces friction for busy professionals.
*   `LOW-PRIORITY`: Gamification features like badges or points.

**3. Tech Stack Assessment:**
The current Firebase backend is fine for this stage. However, the image loading is slow. We should implement image compression and a CDN before launch.

**4. Primary Go-to-Market Risk:**
*   **Risk:** Competing with established platforms like Meetup and Eventbrite. Our differentiation will be the tight curation of *professional* events, not the volume of listings.

This provides a clear, actionable path to a more marketable product."

**Bad Response (Generic Brainstormer):**

"Cool idea! We could add a feature for users to create their own events, and maybe a chat function for each event. What if we also added a map view to see where events are happening? We could also integrate with Spotify to create event playlists!"
